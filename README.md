# Maaya-Labs-Submission
## Submission for computer vision internship


In this assignment, I have loaded an image, made use of opencv functions to gray scale,threshold, dilate the image and create masks around required objects.
With the help of LaMa algotrithm, image inpainting was done to restore background in mask regions.
There is an alternate method in open cv to generate/inpaint background
